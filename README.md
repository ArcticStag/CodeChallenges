# Coding challenges

This is a repository with all the coding challenges that I have completed. Currently there is only one, though I do plan to add more in the future.

I completed my first coding challenge while I was awaiting an answer to a StackOverflow question. I hope that as I complete more of these projects in the future this will help me to grow as a developer.

If you have read this, Thanks a bunch. I appreciate your time and effort.
