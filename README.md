# My FizzBang coding challenge

A simple node.js typescript project for the coding challenge FizzBang

## My solution

Turns out that I made this project more complex than it needed to be. I used the number divided by the target minus the floor of the number divided by the target and compared to 0 for each of Fizz and Bang. For FizzBang I completed the same comparison with the && clause to confirm that it was divisible by 3 and 5.

## What i learned

After completing this challenge I learned that using the % operator quickly and easily allows you to find if one number is divisible by another. Additionally, I never thought to check if a number was divisible by 15 which would give FizzBang using a single equation instead of two other equations.

This also showed me that while I may be able to solve a problem there is often more than one way to solve the same problem.
